        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Abdulahi, and I’m 18 years old. I live in Borlange and i was borned in Somalia I used to study society, in Hagagymnasiet and this the first time for me trying out programming
            When I started programming, I was facing some problems because I had a MacBook, and it’s different from Microsoft. The way things work on a Mac is not the same, so I had trouble doing simple tasks at first. It took some time to get used to, but I figured it out by watching YouTube videos that showed me how to do things step by step
            Another problem I had was with changing CSS. I couldn’t make the website look the way I wanted, and it was really frustrating. But after playing around with it for a while and trying different things, I finally understood how it worked.

        <h2>My interest</h2>
        <p>I have a lot of interests that keep me happy and busy. One of the things I enjoy most is playing football. Whether I’m just kicking the ball around with friends or playing in a more serious game, I love being on the field and staying active. Football helps me relax, have fun, and it also keeps me fit.


            Spending time with my family and friends is really important to me. I like being with them, whether it’s having a nice dinner, going out together, or just hanging out and talking. These moments make me feel close to the people I care about.
           
            I also enjoy traveling. In the past year, I’ve been lucky enough to visit four different countries. I’ve walked through the busy streets of Spain, relaxed on the beautiful beaches of Greece, explored the amazing history of Italy, and experienced the rich culture of Japan. Traveling helps me learn new things, meet different people, and see the world in new ways..</p>
