      <p>
        HI! <br />
        my name is Ahmed, I like skating and designing websites in my free time
        <br />
        But since I'm new at this I keep making mistakes nad some are harder to
        fix then other <br />
        This is a website I'm designing, its just a text about me and stuff I
        have been trying out. <br />
        some turned out great but other no so much. <br />
        Theres songs and videos and links that lead to .... I guess you have to
        find out!..
